== Ember TODO - Ember v.1.0.0-pre4

This is an example app of Ember, version 1.0.0-pre4.
We are using the new router and this app should demonstrate
what is closed to be how the final APIs are.

The app is rather simple. It has todo objects and all todos belongs to a list.
As of writing, we are using fixtures as our backend, but I guess I'll flip over
to the REST adapter soon.


== How to get started

`rake db:create`
`rake db:migrate`
`rake db:seed`
`rails s`
